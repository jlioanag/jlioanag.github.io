# One month with the Boox Page

After a month of use, my Boox Page has held up very well. I haven't had to charge it more than once in the span of a month. This is definitely due to my on/off reading habits... Backlighting is great, offers much needed clarity when out and about.

My use cases outlined in the previous post have still held true - I've read 3x manga and 1x novel so far with no complaints. 3rd party launcher of choice is Nova Launcher set up to be super minimal (as all I should be doing is reading).

Despite hearing bad things about the stock magnetic folio case, it has done great so far both at home and outdoors, albeit I have yet to drop it. I'd definitely want to purchase a cheap yet sturdy case especially when I take it abroad in the future.

So far it has enabled me to read at a much higher frequency than I did previously, which is definitely something to be happy with. Despite liking the texture and feel of a physical copy, digital is just much more convenient (less bulky especially with large ass books).

Happy reading
